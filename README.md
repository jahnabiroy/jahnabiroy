### Hi there 👋

I am an undergrad at IIT Delhi in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Apart from being on an active spree of learning about new ideas and technologies, you might find me unwinding with a cup of coffee and a piece of paper to scribble ideas or drawings, wherever the mind takes me.

Other than the perennial overload of assignments and evaluations, feel free to hit me up for a quick chat or a deep ethical discussion!
